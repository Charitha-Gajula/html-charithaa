  <h1>Charitha's Resume</h1>
  <h6>She is an amazing person </h6>
  <p><em>There's not a single website thatt tells u about her and so here we are to give u the most valuable information of all time that u can find ABSOLUTELY no where</em></p>
  <p><strong>It all started with her <amaz> amazing entry on this planet to grace the pitiable human creatures with her <em>extraordinary</em> presence. </amaz></strong></p>
  <hr>
  <h2>Her accomplisments, <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/awesome#:~:text=causing%20or%20inducing%20awe%3B%20inspiring,white%20convertible%20is%20totally%20awesome.">Defining her</a></h2>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Her birth, DUH!!!!!</p></li>
  <li><p>Her staying on this stupid planet</p></li>
  <li><p>Her breathing the same air as you pitiable human creatures.</p></li>
  <li><p>Her dealing with seeing ur disgusting personalities(mental) and being patient enough to not leave you to rot in hell, <strong>Hell here obviously means this yucky world</strong></p></li>

<h2><a href="https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/adjectives/list-of-positive-adjectives.html">These 125 words are just her basic characteristics.</a></h2>
<hr>
  <h2>Why?</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The question remains as to why is she even living with the most pathetic creatures of all time, <em>The human creatures</em></li>
    <li>To answer that question lets ask the 2nd question thats in all our heads, What on earth did this planet do to deserve such a fantastic goddess on our planet.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>The answer is that she just wanted to experience ur normal and give a new normal to u people, what with her being overly awesome,her new normal will be extraordinary for u guysss. And to answer the question as to what did u guys do to deserve such a gift is that she just pitied u too much what with her being a very kind modest person.</h2>
